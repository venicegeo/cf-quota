# CF Quotas

This utility is meant to be run from a Jenkins job. It queries the
cloudfoundry API for any quotas set on an arbitrary space.

It uses environment variables already present populate the values
for the spaces to query, as well as the cloudfoundry API url.

## Jenkins Usage
Once you've configured your job in Jenkins, this utility requires no
set up to work with Piazza. The `JenkinsFile` provides the environment
variables needed to:

1. Log in to PCF using credentials stored in Jenkins
2. Retrieve a PCF oauth token for API authentication
3. Query the spaces set as environment variables
4. Get the GUIDS for those spaces
5. Determine whether quotas are set for those GUIDS
6. If any are found, the utility exits with a 1, indicating failure

## Using Locally
You need the following environment variables set:

- `PCF_API_ENDPOINT`: 'api.yourpcfendpoing.io'
- `PHASE_ONE_PCF_SPACE`: 'space-one''
- `PHASE_TWO_PCF_SPACE`: 'space-two'
- `PROD_PCF_SPACE`: 'space-three'

You can set each of those with `$ export VARIABLE_NAME="somevalue"`.

Then in this directory:

`$ python cf-quota/cf-quota.py`

Which will return:

```
Getting quotas for space space-one...
Getting quotas for space space-two...
Getting quotas for space space-three...
No quota set for space: space-one
No quota set for space: space-two
No quota set for space: space-three
```
